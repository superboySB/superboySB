## Hi there 👋

I am a stupid PhD from the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/), Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT, 北京理工大学计算机学院), under the supervision of [Prof. Chi Harold Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3IgFTEkAAAAJ).  I received both of my Bachelor's degree and Docter's degree from BIT (Software Engineering: 2015-2019 / Computer Science and Technology: 2019-2025).

My research interest includes mobile crowdsensing and unmanned vehicles, with the consideration of 5G communication modeling and reinforcement learning techniques. I have published more than 10 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e2c7Kt0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FsuperboySB%2FsuperboySB.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international conferences (e.g., KDD, ICDE, CoRL, INFOCOM) and journals (e.g., TKDE, TMC). I am also one of the Student Liaison of [RLChina](http://rlchina.org/) committee.

**Contact:** I'm always glad to discuss or collaborate! If interested, feel free to email me at **daizipeng1997@gmail.com**.

### 🔥 News
- *2025.06*: 🎉🎉 Congratulations to Zihao for open-sourcing [UavNetSim-v1](https://github.com/Zihao-Felix-Zhou/UavNetSim-v1) — a comprehensive, Python-based simulation platform for UAV networks. It models key layers including the network, MAC, and physical layers, along with UAV mobility and energy dynamics. The platform is highly extensible for beginners in the networking and communications community, empowering users to design and test custom protocols for a wide range of applications.
- *2025.05*: 🤠🤠 My [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FA6C0AAAAAJ) citations have exceeded 500!
